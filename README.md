---

## Help:

- Create a bot using [Bot Father](https://t.me/botfather).
- Get bot token.
- Get the chat id of the account to which the bot will send user messages. [Get telegram ID](https://t.me/my_id_bot).


- Clone the project.
- Go to the project folder.
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- In the project folder, create a file `.env`

Contents of the .env file:

```env
PERSONAL_API_TOKEN="Your telegram bot token"
ADMIN_CHAT_ID="Your telegram chat id"
```


- Create a `config.json` file in the project folder, copy the data from the `config_example.json` file to the `.config.json` file.
- Replace the "Name" and "Description" lines in the `.config.json` file with the ones you need.

Example `.config.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Smart Legion Lab",
    "description": "I am a developer specializing in creating web applications, libraries, console and graphical applications, as well as bots for Telegram and VK using Python.",
    "url": "https://smartlegionlab.github.io"
}
```

- Launching the bot: `python bot.py`

### Termux:

- Install Termux
- Run Termux app
- `termux-wake-lock`
- `pkg update`
- `pkg upgrade`
- `pkg install termux-tools`
- `pkg install python`
- `pkg install python-pip`
- `pkg install python-pip`
- `pkg install git`
- `pkg install vim`
- The problem with installing aiogram is solved by installing rust: `pkg install rust`
- Clone repo.
- Create a `.env` file.
- Create a `config.json` file.
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python bot.py`

> Now you don't need a server! Your Telegram bot is hosted and running right on your phone.
